        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C). Lightly coat an 8.5 to 9 inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Combine butter, garlic, and herbs in a medium bowl and stir until well blended. Unroll 1 can of bread dough onto a flat surface. Spread half of butter mixture over the dough and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese and 1 cup of mozzarella. Cut the dough into 12 squares.  Repeat with remaining dough, butter, and cheeses. </li>
            <li>Stack the dough squares on top of each other and arrange them in the prepared baking dish. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through in the center, 40 to 50 minutes. If bread becomes too dark,  loosely cover with foil halfway through baking.</li>
            <li>Allow bread to cool about 5 minutes before removing the loaf to a serving tray.</li>
